# Template

Are you seeking for a contemporary stack template so you can stop wasting time setting up your projects? Maybe it can assist you, then. This project serves as the blueprint for the current web stack. It is free software, therefore you are free to alter and/or distribute it in accordance with the MIT license.

With the help of this template, you can create a full-stack project that uses Next.js and all the other tools required to create a SOLID API REST with automated tests, front-end documentation, and more.

## Using this template

The following command can be used to create a new project based on this:

```
npx degit renatobmps/template_web new_project_name
```

To change directory and get start, you can use:

```
cd new_project_name
```

Well, the node version used was *lts/hydrogen (v18.16.1)*, so I recommend using the same version. With [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can do it with:

```
nvm install
```

Now, you can install all dependencies using a regular ```npm i``` or:
```
npm install
```
